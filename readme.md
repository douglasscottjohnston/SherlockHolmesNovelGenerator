# Sherlock Holmes Novel Generator

## Description
I made this for a class project. It uses a Tri-Gram Markov model trained on three Sherlock Holmes novels to generate a new novel.  For more information, each Python file contains detailed comments.

## How to use
To use the program simply run the main function in Tester.py. To change the story length edit the STORY_LENGTH constant at line 8 in Tester.py.
