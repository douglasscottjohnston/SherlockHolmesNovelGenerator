# Sherlock Holmes Novel Generator

## Description
I made this for a class project. It uses a Tri-Gram Markov model trained on three Sherlock Holmes novels to generate a new novel.  For more information, each Python file contains detailed comments.

## How to use
To use the program simply run the main function in Tester.py. Once the program finishes running, the story will be in Readme.txt. To change the story length edit the STORY_LENGTH constant at line 8 in Tester.py.
